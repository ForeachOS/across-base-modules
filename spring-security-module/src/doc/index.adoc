== About
This module enables support for {spring-security-url}[Spring security] for the Across based application.
The standard Spring security filter chain and method security annotation processors will be registered automatically if this module is present.

=== Module dependencies

|===
|Module |Type |Description

|{across-hibernate-module-url}[AcrossHibernateJpaModule]
|extension
|Creates the <<auditable-entity-interceptor,AuditableEntityInterceptor>> bean.

|===
=== Module settings
{module-name} does not have any settings.

[[cache-configuration]]
=== Cache configuration
{module-name} uses the following caches:

|===
|Name |Description

|securityPrincipalCache +
 (`SpringSecurityModuleCache.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL`)
|Caches `SecurityPrincipal` instances by principal name.
Used by the default <<security-principal,`SecurityPrincipalService`>>.

== What's new in this version?
:numbered!:
=== 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
Requires Across 2.0.0+.

* compatibility release for Spring 4.2 and Spring Security 4
* added <<security-principal-label-resolver,`SpringSecurityLabelResolver`>> infrastructure

=== 1.1.0.RELEASE
`SecurityPrincipalService#authenticate()` now returns a `Closeable` instance.

=== 1.0.0.RELEASE
Initial public release available on http://search.maven.org/[Maven central].

:numbered:
== Module configuration
The `SpringSecurityModule` registers 2 separate modules.
The `SpringSecurityInfrastructureModule` provides the <<security-principal,SecurityPrincipal infrastructure>> as early as possible during the bootstrap phase.
The `SpringSecurityModule` itself is responsible for registering the security filters.
Only the `SpringSecurityModule` should be manually added to the `AcrossContext`, the infrastructure module will be added automatically.

== Configuring web security
The `SpringSecurityModule` enables support for `SpringSecurityWebConfigurer` implementations to be provided by different modules.
Usually this is done by implementing your own `SpringSecurityWebConfigurerAdapter`.
Every `SpringSecurityWebConfigurerAdapter` results in a separate request filter to be added to the Spring security filter chain.
Once a request has been handled by a filter, all remaining filters will be skipped.

For this reason *it is vital that `SpringSecurityWebConfigurerAdapter` instances are added in the correct order and are correctly scoped to the subset of requests they are meant for*.
The `SpringSecurityModule` respects all bean ordering rules that Across provides: using the module order by default and allowing the use of `@Order`, `@OrderInModule` or their respective interfaces.

NOTE: Spring security itself allows very advanced configuration and customization.
Please refer to the official {spring-security-url}[Spring security] documentation for more details.

=== Debugging SpringSecurityWebConfigurer ordering
If you want to trace the different configurers that are being applied, you should enable `DEBUG` logging for class `com.foreach.across.modules.spring.security.config.AcrossWebSecurityConfiguration`.
This will output the different configurer beans in the order they will be applied, along with their type, bean and module name (if available).

[[security-principal]]
== SecurityPrincipal abstraction
The `SpringSecurityModule` provides an additional abstraction layer on top of the standard `Authentication` in the form of the `SecurityPrincipal` interface.
Other modules like the {user-module-url}[UserModule] and {oauth2-module-url}[OAuth2Module] provide an implementation of  the {javadoc-securityprincipal}[`SecurityPrincipal`] concept.

Since `SecurityPrincipal` is a relatively straightforward interface, a principal can be pretty much anything (user, group, machine...).
The only requirement is that every `SecurityPrincipal` has a *unique principal name* that identifies it.

Several beans are available for interacting with the current security principal:

|===
| Type | Description

| `SecurityPrincipalService`
| Allows you to fetch any `SecurityPrincipal` by its unique principal name using a backing `SecurityPrincipalRetrievalStrategy`.
Also provides some helper methods to quickly authenticate or de-authenticate a principal.

| `CurrentSecurityPrincipalProxy`
| Proxies the current security principal (if there is one).
Allows authority checking from anywhere in your code using the `hasAuthority(String)` method.

The {spring-security-acl-module-url}[SpringSecurityAclModule] wires a `CurrentAclSecurityPrincipalProxy` instead that provides additional methods to check for ACL permissions.

|===

.Example of using the SecurityPrincipalService to authenticate a principal
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
    // execute a section within the scope of an authenticated SecurityPrincipal,
    // when the block closes the previous authentication will be reset
    try ( CloseableAuthentication authenticatedBlock
                        = securityPrincipalService.authenticate( principal ) ) {
        // do something
    }
----

=== SecurityPrincipalRetrievalStrategy
The default `SecurityPrincipalService` uses a backing `SecurityPrincipalRetrievalStrategy` to fetch the actual principal based on its unique name.
If you want to define your own custom implementation you can do so by replacing the strategy implementation, see the javadoc and source code for more information.

=== SecurityPrincipal caching
The default `SecurityPrincipalService` uses the <<cache-configuration,*securityPrincipalCache*>> for retrieving principal instances.
If the cache does not return an instance, the request is delegated to the the `SecurityPrincipalRetrievalStrategy`.
Actually maintaining the cache however is left to the implementation providers, the default `SecurityPrincipalService` only caches `null` values (principal not found).
Examples can be found in `SecurityPrincipal` providing modules, for example {user-module-url}[UserModule].

[[security-principal-label-resolver]]
=== SecurityPrincipalLabelResolver
Any module can define one or more {javadoc-securityprincipallabelresolver}[`SecurityPrincipalLabelResolver`] beans.
These are used to generate a pretty label for a given `SecurityPrincipal` instance.
`SecurityPrincipalLabelResolver` instances are ordered and the first resolver to return a valid label will be used.

`SecurityPrincipalLabelResolver` beans should not be used directly but through the exposed `SecurityPrincipalLabelResolverStrategy`.

NOTE: It is a best practice to provide a `SecurityPrincipalLabelResolver` for every `SecurityPrincipal` implementation your module provides.
The resolver beans do not need to be exposed.

== AllowableActions
`SpringSecurityModule` also provides an `AllowableActions` construct that can easily be used to define a set of actions that can be performed on an item.
The purpose is for code to check if an action is present in the `AllowableActions` collection, meaning that the action can be performed.
This helps decoupling your business code from the specifics of the security layer and can be supported in both an ACL and non-ACL context.

A single `AllowableAction` is identified by a unique string, making it very easy to extend.
Useful implementations can be found in the `com.foreach.across.modules.spring.security.actions` package.
The `AuthorityMatchingAllowableActions` maps `AllowableAction` on `AuthorityMatcher` and provides concrete implementation supporting both `Authentication` and `SecurityPrincipal`.

Actions can be mapped against anything (most likely authorities or ACL permissions) and can also be completely different depending on the target they need to be applied to.
This allows for as much granularity you might want, without having to change your permission model.

.Example of mapping AllowableActions against GrantedAuthorities
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
    @Autowired
    private CurrentSecurityPrincipalProxy currentPrincipal;

    public AllowableActions createAllowableActionsForCurrentSecurityPrincipal() {
        Map<AllowableAction, AuthorityMatcher> actionAuthorityMatcherMap = new HashMap<>();
        actionAuthorityMatcherMap.put( AllowableAction.READ, AuthorityMatcher.allOf( "read items" ) );
        actionAuthorityMatcherMap.put( AllowableAction.UPDATE, AuthorityMatcher.allOf( "write items" ) );

        return AuthorityMatchingAllowableActions.forSecurityPrincipal( currentPrincipal, actionAuthorityMatcherMap )
    }
----

TIP: Use the `AllowableAction` concept to hide specifics of the security permission layer.

[[auditable-entity-interceptor]]

== AuditableEntityInterceptor
If the {across-hibernate-module-url}[AcrossHibernateJpaModule] is present in the Across context, an `AuditableEntityInterceptor` bean will be created.
Any entity implementing the `com.foreach.across.modules.hibernate.business.Auditable` interface will get its auditing properties updated before it is persisted.
